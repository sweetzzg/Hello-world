   How to preprocess data with advanced analysis algorithms and leverage it into applications is a crucial task in practice from a holistic 
viewpoint [1]. To this end, distributed data processing has been proposed to deal with a wide range of industrial applications [2]. 
On the one hand, Jashapara et al. considered well-established information technologies such as databases and data mining for discovering 
knowledge [3-5]. On the other hand, the workflow used for processing real-life data can be created by tools, methods, and standards that 
provide better support in the domain of knowledge management, modeling, simulation, validation and other aspects of designing, testing, and 
commissioning [6-8]. Meanwhile, the amount of process data obtained from engineering has been significantly increasing. Personalized and 
efficient data preprocessing encountered challenges to develop next-generation intelligent systems, such as maintaining the quality, 
accessibility and traceability of data, reviewing and reusing knowledge as well as providing useful workflows for practical applications.
